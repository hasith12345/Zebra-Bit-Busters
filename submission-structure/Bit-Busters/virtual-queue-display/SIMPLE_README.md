# ðŸš¨ Simple Virtual Queue Alert System

## âœ… Exactly What You Requested

I've created a simplified system that focuses on **just two things**:

1. **ðŸ“± Large QR Code Display** - When customer count exceeds 6
2. **ðŸš¨ Customer Alert Display** - Real-time notifications from your dataset

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### When Queue is Normal (< 6 customers):
- Shows "All Stations Running Smoothly" 
- Green status display

### When ANY Station Gets 6+ Customers:
- **ðŸ”¥ LARGE QR CODE appears automatically**
- Focused on the busiest station
- Clear "Scan to Join Virtual Queue" message

### When Customer Scans QR Code:
- **ðŸš¨ Customer Alert Screen** 
- Shows: "Your Turn is Ready! Please proceed to SCC3"
- Or: "Please Wait - Estimated time: X minutes"

## ðŸ“Š Real Data Integration

âœ… **Reads from your actual `queue_monitoring.jsonl`**  
âœ… **Monitors all stations: SCC1, SCC2, SCC3, SCC4, RC1**  
âœ… **Uses real customer counts from dataset**  
âœ… **Updates every 3 seconds**  

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
cd virtual-queue-display
./start-simple.sh
```

**Access**: http://localhost:3000

## ðŸ“± Live Demo

**Current Status** (from your real data):
```
SCC1: 7 customers ðŸš¨ BUSY (QR code showing)
SCC2: 3 customers âœ… OK  
SCC3: 6 customers ðŸš¨ BUSY (QR code showing)
SCC4: 2 customers âœ… OK
RC1: 1 customers âœ… OK
```

**Result**: Large QR code displayed for SCC1 (busiest station)

## ðŸŽ¨ QR Code Design

- **256x256 pixel QR code** (large and clear)
- **Static content** - doesn't change dynamically  
- **Clean white background** with blue gradient border
- **Clear instructions**: "Scan to Join Virtual Queue"

## ðŸ“‹ Customer Alert Flow

1. **Customer sees large QR code** when station busy
2. **Scans QR** â†’ Gets redirected to alert page
3. **Sees waiting message** with estimated time
4. **Gets ready notification** when turn is up
5. **Proceeds to station** (e.g., "Please proceed to SCC3")

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- **Frontend**: React with large, responsive design
- **Backend**: Python Flask reading real queue data
- **Data Source**: Your actual `queue_monitoring.jsonl` file  
- **Threshold**: Exactly 6+ customers as requested
- **Updates**: Live data refresh every 3 seconds

## âœ… Perfect for Store Display

This system is designed to run on:
- **Store displays/TVs** showing the QR code
- **Customer mobile devices** for alerts
- **Digital signage** at busy stations
