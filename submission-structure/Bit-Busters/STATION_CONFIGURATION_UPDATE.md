# 🏪 Station Configuration Update - Project Sentinel

## ✅ Changes Completed

The system has been successfully updated to reflect the proper retail store counter configuration:

### Initial Active Counters (Start of Day)

- **SCC1** - Self-Checkout Counter 1 ✅ ACTIVE (Efficiency: 95%)
- **RC1** - Regular Counter 1 ✅ ACTIVE (Efficiency: 93%)

### Additional Counters (Activate as Demand Increases)

- **SCC2** - Self-Checkout Counter 2 ⚪ STANDBY (Efficiency: 92%)
- **SCC3** - Self-Checkout Counter 3 ⚪ STANDBY (Efficiency: 94%)
- **SCC4** - Self-Checkout Counter 4 ⚪ STANDBY (Efficiency: 96%)

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **api_server.py** - Updated station definitions and API responses
2. **dashboard.html** - Updated station display and added proper status indicators
3. **dashboard.py** - Updated sample station data configuration
4. **event_detector.py** - Updated pattern recognition for SCC counters

## 🚀 How to Run the Updated System

### Terminal 1 - Start Streaming Server

```bash
cd "d:\Application files - Do not delete\github\Zebra-Bit-Busters\submission-structure\Bit-Busters\src"
python ..\..\..\data\streaming-server\stream_server.py --port 8765 --speed 10
```

### Terminal 2 - Start AI Monitoring System

```bash
cd "d:\Application files - Do not delete\github\Zebra-Bit-Busters\submission-structure\Bit-Busters\src"
python main.py
```

### Terminal 3 - Optional React Dashboard

```bash
cd "d:\Application files - Do not delete\github\Zebra-Bit-Busters\submission-structure\Bit-Busters\react-dashboard"
npm start
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

- **At startup**: Only SCC1 and RC1 will show as ACTIVE
- **As demand increases**: Additional self-checkout counters (SCC2, SCC3, SCC4) will automatically activate
- **Customer preference**: RC1 remains available for customers who prefer staff assistance
- **Efficiency optimization**: Self-checkout counters encourage customer self-service

## 🏬 Retail Store Logic

This configuration matches real retail operations where:

- One self-checkout counter opens first thing in the morning
- One regular counter remains staffed for customer assistance
- Additional self-checkout counters open as queue length increases
- Staff can monitor and assist customers across all active counters
